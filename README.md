# Aging-Movies

**Motivation**

Thousands of movies are released every year, but only some become cuturally significant (classics). Some on the other hand despite having good ratings and being well received at the time of release, become forgotten. IMDB provides a good way to measure both quality and public attention (ratings and number of votes. Using the dataset we attempt to answer the question: *"What structure and characteristics differentiate classic films from forgotten ones?"*
