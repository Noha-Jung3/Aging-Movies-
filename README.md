# Aging-Movies
This is a project to determine why some movies age well and become classics while others become forgotten by time despite doing well and being popular at the time of release.

**The purpose:**
This is an interesting way to find out why some movies age well and become classics and why many don't using data.

**The Aim:**
Determine what factors allow movies to become classics and predict if an upcoming movie will become a classic or forgotten.

**The Hypothesis:**
If a movie has a moderate runtime (not too long not too short), follows a trend at the time, has high ratings and review counts then it will be a "classic".
